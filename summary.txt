This is the start for the CJ4ES final report.

The aim of this project was to develop a prototype development environment
and platform for safety-critical software for embedded applications.
The three core constituents are: (1) a profile of the Java programming
language that is tailored for safety-critical applications,
(2) a predictable Java processor built with FPGA technology,
and (3) an Eclipse based application development environment that
binds the profile and the platform together and provides analyses
that supports a safety case. Within the CJ4ES project we have
contributed to all three topics:

A Java programming profile for safety-critical applcations


A predictable Java processor

 JOP - about SCJ adapted, 


An Eclipse based application development environment

Eclipse with libraries, AAU tools?
